At work we use Powershell to monitor folders.
It can be used since Windows Vista (.NET and PowerShell is preinstalled) without any additional tools.

This script monitors a certain folder and writes a logfile. You can replace the action and do whatever you want e.g call an external tool

Example log file
11/23/2014 19:22:04, Created, D:\source\New Text Document.txt
11/23/2014 19:22:09, Changed, D:\source\New Text Document.txt
11/23/2014 19:22:09, Changed, D:\source\New Text Document.txt
11/23/2014 19:22:14, Deleted, D:\source\New Text Document.txt
   
    
    
    
How to use
Create a new text file
Copy & paste the above code
Change the following settings to your own needs:
folder to monitor: $watcher.Path = "D:\source"
file filter to include only certain file types: $watcher.Filter = "*.*"
include subdirectories yes/no: $watcher.IncludeSubdirectories = $true
Save and rename it to StartMonitoring.ps1
Start monitoring by Right click Â» Execute with PowerShell
To stop monitoring, it's enough to close your PowerShell window
